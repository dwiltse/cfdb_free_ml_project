# Setup Session Summary

**Date:** September 1, 2025

## Environment and Project Setup Steps

1. **Created Python Virtual Environment**
   - Used `uv venv` to create an isolated environment for package management.

2. **Installed and Upgraded pip**
   - Ensured pip was available and up-to-date in the virtual environment.

3. **Installed Databricks CLI (Latest Version)**
   - Used `uv pip install databricks-cli` to install the latest CLI.

4. **Removed Old CLI Versions**
   - Uninstalled legacy Databricks CLI versions to avoid conflicts.

5. **Authenticated with Databricks**
   - Used `databricks auth login` and OAuth for secure, interactive CLI authentication.
   - Created and used a named profile (e.g., `cfdb-free-ml-windows`).

6. **Verified CLI Access**
   - Successfully listed workspace directories using the CLI and profile flag.

7. **Resolved Bundle Context Issues**
   - Learned to use the `-p <profile>` flag to avoid bundle context when running workspace commands.

## Next Steps

- Begin project development and data engineering tasks.
- Use the `project_notes/` folder to log progress, context, and troubleshooting for future sessions.

## Ready to Push to GitHub?

Yes, the environment and project setup are complete and stable. It is recommended to commit and push your changes to GitHub now to save your progress and enable collaboration or future recovery.
